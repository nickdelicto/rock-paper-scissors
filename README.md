# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This project helps put my early JS skills into use.

It demonstrates my knowledge of:
- how to define functions
- how to declare variables
- how to prompt for user input
- how to use loops
- built-in basic functions like Math.random(), Math.floor, toLowerCase,
console.log(), alert(), etc.

FYI, I'm loving my learning journey!

Enjoy!
